Forked by Hugh Emberson <hemberson@storreduce.com> to add support for
compressing and decompressing raw Flate streams.

A GZip stream is a Flate stream with a header and a trailer.  This
fork allows us to avoid outputting the header and trailer during
compression.

Below is the original README from https://github.com/mistsys/cgzip

Cloned from
  github.com/youtube/vitess/go/cgzip
but without the rest of the repo.

I (nsd) tested several alternatives to encoding/flate
for speed on arm32 cortex-A9 cores and compression
of redundant JSON blobs like our current day AP stats
and found cgzip was not only the fastest but the best
compressor too.

 pkg  : time            relative to baseline                 compressed size     compression ratio
flate : 18.926959ms  =  0.9999999887711191  x faster ;  ratio 2682 / 12011 = 22.32953126300891 %
cgzip : 2.235148ms  =  8.467877277696212  x faster ;    ratio 2258 / 12011 = 18.799433852302055 % <------ :-)
klaus : 8.709794ms  =  2.173066134955322  x faster ;    ratio 2831 / 12011 = 23.57006077762051 %
lz4 : 11.124966ms  =  1.7013048063651215  x faster ;    ratio 3720 / 12011 = 30.97160935808842 %
lzo : 2.243274ms  =  8.437203411260768  x faster ;      ratio 3574 / 12011 = 29.756056947797855 %
snappy : 2.462661ms  =  7.685570902327792  x faster ;   ratio 3668 / 12011 = 30.538672883190408 %

However cgzip is part of a much larger repo of stuff from youtube, so
I extracted just the cgzip bit, and the LICENSE file, and made this
repo.
